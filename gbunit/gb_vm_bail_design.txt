Set chg_gam if either a mock fail occurs to bail out early or if a RET
(or variant) is encountered and stack pointer is greater (lower) or equal
to where it started when the test call was made.  If stack pointer is
lower than when the function started stack corruption occurred.

Alternatively, vm keeps track of call stack and when a RET is encountered
when the call stack is empty (not in a subroutine) set chg_gam.


Setting chg_gam should kick out of rom_exec() and start_vm() thus
thus returning control to GBUnit and tests.
